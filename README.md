# The Sixty-Six Wards Turnout Tracker

The turnout tracker is a citizen science tool to estimate realtime turnout on election day.

Citizens across the city vote, and submit their voter number in their division. 

The tool uses historical voting rates and correlations to estimate in real time the total turnout across the city.

## Documentation
The documentation is a work in progress.

[methodology.html](methodology.html) outlines the math.
